### Task tracker / ToDo app features
- A task tracker with additional feature supporting quick notes. 
- Supports quick links as well as managing them.
- A clean UI. [Bootstrap with some modification of styles.]
  - This extension's UI is based on the bootstrap styles (css) coming from CDN links
  - And the Java scripts supporting the Bootstrap UI had to be stored as minified version inside the extension due to some restriction on usage of CDN link for bootstrap JS
- Of cource, the task tracking with some features like
  - Hiding completed tasks
  - Searching tasks by **title** (searching by description, sorting by due date or date added will be covered in subsequent releases.)
  - Pagination (Pure JS)

Code is under development so it is still a mess and needs some serious refactoring.
